## GitHub Standards

Make a branch for new features or areas you're working on. Commit often to that branch while you're working, push to the 
branch when you're finished for the work period. Merge branch to master after you've finished the feature and thoroughly tested.
Leave useful commit messages and merge comments.

## Coding Standards

Follow PEP 8 Python coding style standards, [which can be found here.](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
Should go without saying that we follow OOP standards (make objects not procedural spaghetti code) and comment your code.

[**Naming Conventions**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions)
* Class names are CapWords
* Variables are lowercase_underscore_spaces (but shorter than this lol)
* Functions are same as variables
* We're using the Qt framework for the GUI, these methods are camelCase. When using it, stick with camelCase, outside of a Qt
method, stick with PEP 8 standards (from PEP 8: "mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that's already the prevailing 
style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility.").
